# VSHacks2025 - HeartBEAT
# This is our project done digitally by Jonathan, Steven and Matthew.
# The idea behind this is a program that promotes fitness by tracking your heart rate with a twist. If your heart rate falls below 120 BPM, the Arduino System will start punching the user, and an alarm will blare until the user raises their heart rate to an adequate amount. 
# We understand that fitness doesn't just stem from fear, but also reward, which is why there is also an app that gets the information from the Arduino and rewards the user with points for the amount of exercise they do per hour, which they can then spend in the shop menu. However, it is not as it seems, where a strange being is following you where ever you go.
# Please note that this is a proof of concept of each system. If we were to make this reality, the software would not be coded in scratch but rather a program that can connect to the Arduino's inputs, such as C++, Java, HTML, etc.
